//Basic TS variable declaration stuff
let - cannot be redeclared can be re assigned
example- let a =10; can be assigned again as a=20 but cannot be initialized again by saying let a=30;
const- a variable which cannot be manipulated in any way
function- 
showHide(): void{
        this.showTable = !this.showTable;
}


//Structural Directives
ngIf and ngFor

//Bindings
one way  binding
--Data binding  {{}} - for a tag
--Property binding [] - for an attribute like img src
--Event Binding () - for clikc events takes in function as the value
two way  binding [()]


//ngModel- 
***** Most Imp- HTML cannot understand ngModel-  In order for it to understand we need to import forms module

Used for sending data to Ts - Binding a html tag with a two way binding 
declaration so that it goes in to grab the appropriate data it wants from TS. 

//Pipes- Run time manipulation changing button name etc..
